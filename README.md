Highly Language-Independent Word Lemmatization Using a Machine-Learning Classifier

In short, we train a RandomForest multiclass-multiputput Classifier on lemma-wordform wordpairs encoded by character embeddings obtained from the charcter cooccurrence matrix and test this approach on 25 languages.

The dictionaries were taken from https://github.com/michmech/lemmatization-lists for which we thank Michal MÄ›chura a lot! 

The method is fully described in the article https://www.cys.cic.ipn.mx/ojs/index.php/CyS/article/view/3775.
